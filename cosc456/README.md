Project Title: COSC 456 Computer Graphics Projects
Motivation: The projects included in this folder are
assignments for the Systems Programming course at the
University of Tennessee. The assignments included are:

	Lab1 lab1 - which creates an animated solar
	system using opengl.

	Lab2 index.php - The program has progressions
	with a mesh object that has different shaders
	and lighting.

	Lab3 index.php - The program has the same
	progressions as lab 2 but with an added
	image applied to the object.

	finalp jtar - This program has a bounding box
	that demonstrates a 3d circumferential environment.
	There are objects also placed to give dimensional
	effect. Some improvements or updates would be to
	add a special effect like some animation.

Code Style: Standard opengl, webgl, html, php, javascript

Credits: All programs in the folder come from the Systems
Programming course at the University of Tennessee
