Project Title: Citysim

Motivation: A class assignment that uses special library
belonging to James Plank professor of Computer Science 
University of Tennessee. The library is missing from the
folder. This assignment uses red/black trees and templated
values called jvals to graph cities and show shortest
routes between them.

Build Status: There is an executable called 'citysim' and
a makefile for the .cpp files but the special library that
gives the definitions for jrb and jval types is missing.
Will try to include in future update.

Code Style: Standard c/c++

Installations: Need c/c++ developer environment and planks
jval, jrb special library

How to Use: To run file do,
	./citysim -write_city_graph | -show_route | etc.

Credits: This program was assigned in the CS302 course at
the University of Tennessee.
