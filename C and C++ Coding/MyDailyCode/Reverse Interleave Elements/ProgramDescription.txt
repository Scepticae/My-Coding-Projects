Program Description:

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the
second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3].
If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.

Program Planning:

1. Input - an array
   Output - an array with second half interleaved with first half in reverse <i class="fa fa-first-order

2. Take in array, perhaps template it to handle any values.

3. Create a queue

4. Create variables count and N
     count to increment each time the back of array is copied in place to the front half
     n to hold the value of half the array

5. Create a for loop to iterate through the numbers array
     check for iteration in the first half of array
     check if iteration is even
       if so, queue the current array element
       copy the item from the back to the current
       increment the count to keep track of items brought from the back of array
     if not even
       queue the current element
       dequeue into current element place
     if not first half
       check for odd
         dequeue into odd location
