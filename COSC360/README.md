Project Title: COSC 360 Systems Programming Projects
Motivation: The projects included in this folder are
assignments for the Systems Programming course at the
University of Tennessee. The assignments included are:

	Lab1 famtree - which iterates through a list of
	people that includes parents and children and
	builds a family tree.

	Lab2 l2p1, l2p2, l2p3 - These programs read in
	a list of hosts and ip addresses which allows
	the user to enter a host and find the information
	associated with that host.

	Lab3 fakemake - This program mimics the makefile

	Lab4 jtar - This program mimics the tar file

	Lab5 test_malloc - This program creates memory
