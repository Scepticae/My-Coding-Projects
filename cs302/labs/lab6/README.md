Project Title: MazeSolver

Motivation: This project was a class assignment that
uses a program called 'mazemake' to build a maze and 
a program called 'mazesolve' to solve the maze using
graphing data structures.

Build Status: There are two executables called 'mazemake'
and 'mazesolve' along with a shellscript that will call
'mazemake' and 'mazesolve'. There is a makefile that will
build the .cpp files.

Code Style: Standard c/c++

Installations: Requires c/c++ development environment
such as linux or visual studio.

Tests: There are .txt files that give the row, columns
and the adjacency matrix for the maze. This builds the
maze and allows it to be solved.

How to Use: Call the .sh script with the m1.txt and 
p1.txt files.

Credits: This assignment was given in the Data Structures
class at the University of Tennessee.
